How to use the auto-generated TypeScript types and JSON Schemas

## Basic usage

When you modify an ontology and the types and schemas are updated, they must be synchronized with the package. This is where the module that is imported for validation and type usage lives. To do this, run:

```bash
npm run contracts:build
```

- This updates the types and JSON Schemas of the package and performs a build.

```bash
npm run contracts:test
```

- This runs the test module under `/examples` to validate that everything still works.
  If it fails, it means you have changed a version or broken something, and you will need to adapt the scripts of this module so that it behaves as expected.

## Usage example

You can see an example of usage at:
`examples\consumer-node-ts\src\index.ts`
