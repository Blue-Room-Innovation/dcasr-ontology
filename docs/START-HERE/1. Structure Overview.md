Each heading illustrates the use of the main folders of the repository.

## `build` folder

> Auto-generated content

This folder contains the derived **artifacts**, automatically generated and **not manually edited**. Its contents are as follows:

- [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) files, `*.schema.json`, auto-generated from the `shacl` files in the `shapes` folder
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) files, `*.ts`, auto-generated from the `*.schema.json` files mentioned above
- `context.jsonld` files, the JSON-LD contexts, which define how data should be interpreted, what the properties mean, and which semantic vocabularies they are connected to
- `merged-ontology.ttl` file, auto-generated from the ontologies in the `ontology` folder
- `reasoned-ontology.ttl` file, auto-generated and with materialized inferences (subclasses, transitive properties, etc.) from the ontologies in the `ontology` folder

## `codelists` folder

This folder contains all files that define explicit lists of allowed values in the ontology, represented as [SKOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Knowledge_Organization_System) concepts.

## `docker` folder

Contains environment isolation with all dependencies pre-installed thanks to the Dockerfile and the `docker.js` wrapper to execute controlled operations in a cross-platform environment.

## `docs` folder

Contains hand-written documentation (generic + domain-specific).

Auto-generated documentation (wiki-style pages) is written to `build/<build_version>/wiki` so it can be published together with the versioned build artifacts.

## `examples` folder

Contains several examples of RDF instances in different formats. These are used for automated validations and are located inside the folder that indicates their version. The `examples/consumer-node-ts` folder contains a Node.js test application to experiment with JSON Schema and TypeScript validations.

## `ontology` folder

Within subfolders that define the version, the `*.ttl` files are located. There are multiple ontologies, some extending the UNECE ontology, while others may be custom.

## `packages` folder

This is where a consumable `Node.js/TypeScript` package is located (used in the `examples/consumer-node-ts` folder), which publishes:

- Auto-generated **JSON Schemas**
- Auto-generated **TypeScript types**
- An integrated **AJV validator** with typed `schemaKey` (the user imports the validator and validates)

## `scripts` folder

This directory contains all scripts and tools to manage ontologies, SHACL validations, and artifact generation.

## `shapes` folder

Contains all SHACL files within the versioned folder `*.shacl.ttl`. It is responsible for the auto-generated artifacts and RDF validation.
