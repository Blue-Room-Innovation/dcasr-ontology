This is a list of validations using **external tools**. The ones developed internally can be found in [[4. Available Tools]].

## Validators

### Validate JSON-LD structure

- [https://json-ld.org/playground/](https://json-ld.org/playground/) or [https://json-ld.org/playground/next/](https://json-ld.org/playground/next/)
  - Paste the JSON-LD. If the format is incorrect, you will get an error; you can also visualize the output in different formats.

### Validate JSON-LD values against the SHAPE

- [https://shacl.org/playground/](https://shacl.org/playground/) or [https://shacl-playground.zazuko.com/](https://shacl-playground.zazuko.com/)
  - Paste the SHAPE and the JSON-LD; it will show the detected issues.

## Generators

### Generate JSON from JSON Schemas

- [https://json-schema-faker.js.org/](https://json-schema-faker.js.org/)

## Important gotchas to keep in mind

These gotchas are the ones you may encounter when using the external tools above. In the internal tools, an effort has been made to avoid these issues.

### SHACL does not validate the original JSON

- SHACL validates the **resulting RDF** after expanding the JSON-LD.
- Type errors in JSON (numbers, empty booleans, etc.) **may not appear** in the result.

### Automatic type coercion in JSON-LD

- If the `@context` enforces a `@type` (`xsd:string`, `xsd:boolean`, etc.):
  - `8750` → `"8750"^^xsd:string`
  - `""` → valid literal

- This can cause **incorrect values to pass SHACL validation**.

### `sh:datatype` does not validate content

- `sh:datatype xsd:boolean` **does not check** `true / false`
- `sh:datatype xsd:string` **accepts empty strings**

You must explicitly add:

- `sh:minLength`
- `sh:pattern`
- `sh:in`

### `sh:nodeKind sh:IRI` accepts empty IRIs

- A value such as:

```json
  "url": ""
```

may be considered a valid IRI.

- SHACL **does not check** whether it is a usable URL.

Solution: use `sh:pattern "^https?://"`

### `sh:minCount 1` only checks existence

- A field with `""` or `"-"` **satisfies `minCount`**
- It does not imply that the value is meaningful or correct.

### `sh:closed true` does not perform semantic validation

- It only prevents undeclared properties.
- It does not validate formats, ranges, or data quality.

### SHACL cannot detect whether a value originally came from a number or a string

- Once expanded to RDF, that information is lost.
- If this is critical → **validate first with JSON Schema**.
