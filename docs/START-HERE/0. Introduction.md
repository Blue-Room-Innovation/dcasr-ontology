## What is this project?

This project provides a set of tools to manage semantic ontologies in the domain of [Blue Room Innovation](https://www.blueroominnovation.com/en/). It automates the validation, generation, and conversion of ontology-related artifacts, allowing developers to:

- **Validate** OWL ontologies and SHACL constraints
- **Generate** TypeScript type definitions from SHACL shapes
- **Produce** human-readable wiki-style documentation
- **Convert** between formats (SHACL → JSON Schema → TypeScript)
- **Include** a Node.js package to use the generated TypeScript types, perform validations, and run **JSON Schema** validations
- **Create** their own ontologies or **extend** the existing ontologies they use

## Why Docker?

All tools run in Docker to ensure **consistency** (the same environment for all developers), **isolation** (avoids conflicts with the local environment), **portability** (Windows, Linux, macOS), and **dependencies** (automatic installation of ROBOT, pyshacl, rdflib, etc.).

## Key technologies

- **OWL 2 (Web Ontology Language)**: Semantic data modeling
- **SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language)**: Data validation constraints
- **ROBOT**: OWL ontology validation and reasoning tool
- **pyshacl**: SHACL validation library
- **RDF/Turtle**: Standard RDF serialization formats
- **JSON Schema**: Data validation and documentation
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development

## How it works

The idea is simple: everything is managed from the ontology and the shapes. With these two, the rest of the artifacts are automatically generated.

Artifact configuration is done in a single place, in `config.yml`. For more information, see [[5. Workflows]].

## Published outputs (GitHub Pages)

This repository publishes generated outputs as static artifacts (indexes, wiki, schemas, TypeScript types) so they can be browsed and consumed via GitHub Pages.

- `build/index.md` is auto-generated and links to versioned build outputs, per-file ontology and SHACL sources, and the wiki.
- The base GitHub Pages URL is configured via `repository.pages_url` in `config.yml`.
