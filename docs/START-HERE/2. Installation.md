For this project, it is recommended to use the prepared Docker environment, since several dependencies are required and, to simplify the setup, everything will be done entirely as it was designed: in Docker.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Node 18+
- Git

## Initial Setup

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Blue-Room-Innovation/dcasr-ontology
cd dcasr-ontology
```

2. Build the Docker image (first time, ~5–10 minutes)

```bash
npm run docker:build
```

## Verify installation

3. Verify configuration

```bash
npm run config:show
```

4. Test the CLI

```bash
npm run help
```

**Expected output:** explanatory message
